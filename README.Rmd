The goal of `{ubep.gpt}` is to provide a simple interface to OpenAI's GPT API. The package is designed to work with dataframes/tibbles and to simplify the process of querying the API. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{ubep.gpt}` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("UBESP-DCTV/ubep.gpt")
```

## Basic example

You can use the `query_gpt` function to query the GPT API. You can decide
if use GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4-turbo models. This function is useful because mainly it iterate the query a decided number of times (10 by default) in case of error (often caused by server overload).

To use the function you need to compose a prompt. You can use the `compose_prompt_api` function to compose the prompt. This function is useful because it helps you to compose the prompt automatically adopting the required API's structure.

Once you have queried the API, you can extract the content of the response using the `get_content` function. You can also extract the tokens of the prompt and the response using the `get_tokens` function.

```{r}
library(ubep.gpt)
prompt <- compose_prompt_api(
  sys_prompt = "You are the assistant of a university professor.",
  usr_prompt = "Tell me about the last course you provided."
)
prompt

res <- query_gpt(
  prompt = prompt,
  model = "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  quiet = FALSE, # default TRUE
  max_try = 2, # default 10
  temperature = 1.5, # default 0 [0-2]
  max_tokens = 100 # default 1000
)

str(res)
get_content(res)
get_tokens(res)
get_tokens(res, "prompt")
get_tokens(res, "all")

```

## Easy prompt-assisted creation

You can use the `compose_sys_prompt` and `compose_usr_prompt` functions to create the system and user prompts, respectively. These functions are useful because they help you to compose the prompts following best practices in composing prompt. In fact the arguments are just the main components every prompt should have. They do just that, composing the prompt for you juxtaposing the components in the right order.

```{r}
sys_prompt <- compose_sys_prompt(
  role = "You are the assistant of a university professor.",
  context = "You are analyzing the comments of the students of the last course."
)
sys_prompt

usr_prompt <- compose_usr_prompt(
  task = "Your task is to extract information from a text provided.",
  instructions = "You should extract the first and last words of the text.",
  output = "Return the first and last words of the text separated by a dash, i.e., `first - last`.",
  style = "Do not add any additional information, return only the requested information.",
  examples = "
    # Examples:
    text: 'This is an example text.'
    output: 'This - text'
    text: 'Another example text!!!'
    output: 'Another - text'",
  text = "Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura"
)
usr_prompt

compose_prompt_api(sys_prompt, usr_prompt) |> 
  query_gpt() |> 
  get_content()
```

## Querying a column of a dataframe

You can use the `query_gpt_on_column` function to query the GPT API on a column of a dataframe. This function is useful because it helps you to iterate the query on each row of the column and to compose the prompt automatically adopting the required API's structure. In this case, you need to provide the components of the prompt creating the prompt template, and the name of the column you what to embed in the template as a "text" to query. All the prompt's components are optional, so you can provide only the ones you need: `role` and `context` compose the system prompt, while `task`, `instructions`, `output`, `style`, and `examples` compose the user prompt (they will be just juxtaposed in the right order) 

```{r example}
db <- data.frame(
  txt = c(
    "I'm very satisfied with the course; it was very interesting and useful.",
    "I didn't like it at all; it was deadly boring.",
    "The best course I've ever attended.",
    "The course was a waste of time.",
    "blah blah blah",
    "woow",
    "bim bum bam"
  )
)

# system
role <- "You are the assistant of a university professor."
context <- "You are analyzing the comments of the students of the last course."

# user
task <- "Your task is to understand if they are satisfied with the course."
instructions <- "Analyze the comments and decide if they are satisfied or not."
output <- "Report 'satisfied' or 'unsatisfied', in case of doubt or impossibility report 'NA'."
style <- "Do not add any comment, return only and exclusively one of the possible classifications."

examples <- "
  # Examples:
  text: 'I'm very satisfied with the course; it was very interesting and useful.'
  output: 'satisfied'
  text: 'I didn't like it at all; it was deadly boring.'
  output: 'unsatisfied'"

db |>
 query_gpt_on_column(
   "txt",
   role = role,
   context = context,
   task = task,
   instructions = instructions,
   output = output,
   style = style,
   examples = examples
 )
```

## Base ChatGPT prompt creation (NOT for API)

You can use the `compose_prompt` function to create a prompt for ChatGPT. This function is useful because it helps you to compose the prompt following best practices in composing prompt. In fact the arguments are just the main components every prompt should have. They do just that, composing the prompt for you juxtaposing the components in the right order. The result is suitable to be copy-pasted on ChatGPT, not to be used with API calls, i.e., it cannot be used with the `query_gpt` function!!

```{r}
compose_prompt(
  role = "You are the assistant of a university professor.",
  context = "You are analyzing the comments of the students of the last course.",
  task = "Your task is to extract information from a text provided.",
  instructions = "You should extract the first and last words of the text.",
  output = "Return the first and last words of the text separated by a dash, i.e., `first - last`.",
  style = "Do not add any additional information, return only the requested information.",
  examples = "
    # Examples:
    text: 'This is an example text.'
    output: 'This - text'
    text: 'Another example text!!!'
    output: 'Another - text'",
  text = "Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura"
)

```
